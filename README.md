## Reflection
This was a 6 weeks long capstone project built during my front-end web development bootcamp at Re-coded. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features all of which has been achieved by leveraging `react`, `react-router-5.0` and `chakra-ui`.
